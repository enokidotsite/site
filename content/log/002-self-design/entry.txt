#### Example paragraph

“There is often more power in ‘knowing how’ rather than ‘knowing that.’ The markers used to navigate a river are indeterminate in order to be practical… The aim is to offer not solutions, but rather mechanisms for generating solutions.”

#### Ideas

- what happens when everyone is a designer
- self branding as autoprogettazione
- consumerism and self expression
- identity and the branded self
- self objectification
- economy of attention
