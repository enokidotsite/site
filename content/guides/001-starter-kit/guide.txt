excerpt:

What’s the easiest way to begin creating an Enoki site during the pre-alpha? With the Starter-kit! It includes an example content structure and site design covering some common patterns.

In this guide we will walk-through installing the starter-kit, explain how to work with and against the defaults, and introduce new ways of putting your site online.

### The Starter-Kit is the glue

Enoki is an ultralight set of tools and methods for publishing online. Right now, the focus is on creating a foundation of great tools for the fast and light programmer. These tools are progressively glued together, each time [abstracting parts](http://substack.net/how_I_write_modules) away into modules.

To understand what those modules are, and how they fit together, Enoki is being designed around the Starter-Kit; the halfway point between using the fully hosted service (never touching code) and using the modules discreetly within your own build (all up in the code).

The Starter-Kit has proven to be super useful even in it’s early state, which is why it’s been published here while still in pre-alpha.

### Installation

The Starter-Kit is for those who have some experience with front-end javascript programming, and know how to use a terminal. All you need to do is clone the Starter-Kit repository and run `npm install`.

```
git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit.git
```

Once installed, run `npm start` to spin up a local development server.

### What’s Provided

The Starter-Kit uses [choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) as a front-end framework. It’s extremely lightweight, easy to understand, and free of [any restrictions](https://medium.com/@raulk/if-youre-a-startup-you-should-not-use-react-reflecting-on-the-bsd-patents-license-b049d4a67dd2). There are also a few examples of common patterns:

- Creating thumbnails
- Generating Feeds
- Markdown formatting
- Example [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) structure

Because of this, the Starter-Kit might feel somewhat heavy to begin with. If you already know what you’re doing, you might want to start with [Blank Design](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-blank-design).

### Going Forward

The Starter-Kit will be adapted as the boundaries between modules become better defined. Because of this, it is maybe pre-mature to use Enoki for client projects, although it is fully intended to work for those soon, too. The first step is introducing the [Panel](/guides/002-panel-preview/).
