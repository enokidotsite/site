excerpt:

What’s the easiest way to begin creating an Enoki site during the pre-alpha? With the Starter-kit! It includes an example content structure and site design covering some common patterns.

In this guide we will walk-through installing the starter-kit, explain how to work with and against the defaults, and introduce new ways of putting your site online.

### The Starter-Kit is the glue

Enoki is an ultralight set of tools and methods for self-publishing online. Right now, the focus is on creating a foundation of great tools for the fast and light programmer. These tools are progressively glued together, each time abstracting parts away into modules.

To understand what those modules are, and how they fit together, Enoki is being designed around the Starter-Kit; the halfway point between using the fully hosted service (never touching code) and using the modules discreetly within your own build (all up in the code).

The Starter-Kit has proven to be super useful, which is why it’s been published here while still in pre-alpha.

### Installation

The Starter-Kit is for those who have some experience with front-end javascript programming, and know how to use a terminal. All you need to do is clone the Starter-Kit repository and run `npm install`.

```
git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit.git
```

Once installed, run `npm start` to spin up a local development server.

### What’s Provided

For now, the Starter-Kit provides a few examples of common patterns:

- Creating thumbnails
- Generating Feeds
- Markdown formatting
- Example [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) structure

Because of this, the Starter-Kit might feel somewhat heavy to begin with. If you already know what you’re doing, you might want to start with [Blank Design](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-blank-design).

### Going Forward

The Starter-Kit will be adapted as the boundaries between modules become better defined. As it is, Enoki is built on top of several evolving open-source projects, including:

- [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo)
- [Dat](https://datproject.org/)
- [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/)/[Hashbase](https://hashbase.io/)

As these projects continue to grow, Enoki will similarly change to best accommodate the contributions of their communities. Because of this, it is perhaps pre-mature to use Enoki for client projects, although it is fully intended work for them, too. The first step is introducing the [Panel](/guides/002-panel-preview).
