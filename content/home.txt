Networks (physical, virtual, social) aren’t going anywhere, and the internet is the largest one today.

That network is becoming increasingly centralized, driven by corperate growth, and designed for maximum engagement. When these corperations fail to generate revenue, entire communities are abandoned and dismantled.

Meanwhile, this network is becoming increasingly entangled with our minds, bodies and, environments.

So, what is there to do?

- Let’s try to make a self-publishing and networking tool which gives everyone autonomous ownership over their data and basic building blocks with great defaults to help them along.

- Let’s place an emphasis on archivability, longevity, and portability—you shouldn’t be locked into a service, or require them to be maintained for your work to exist.

- Let’s build the tool on top of existing [open](https://github.com/choojs/choo) [source](https://beakerbrowser.com) [projects](http://hashbase.io) created by strong and growing communities.

- Let’s use it to make websites and pages today, while considering the implements and environments of tomorrow.

- Let’s make it easy for the novice, enjoyable for the pro, and perfect for personal use or client comissions.

- Let’s try to be fun and light while addressing important issues and doing it right.

- Let’s call it **[Enoki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enokitake)**.

preview: ## Programmer Preview

Know some javascript? The **[Starter Kit](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit)**, which glues together some of the tools, is in pre-alpha today.

```
git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit.git
```

You will run into bugs and limitations, but it’d be great if you could [report them and contribute feedback](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki).

If the project continues to grow, there will be a stream of updates over the next few months. This is also a beta reservation (you know how it goes.)
