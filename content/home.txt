## Programmer Preview

Know some javascript? The [Starter Kit](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit) glues early versions of some tools together, and is in pre-alpha today.

```
git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit.git
```

You will run into bugs and limitations, but it’d be great if you could report them and contribute feedback.
