Know some javascript? The [Starter Kit](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit) glues early versions of some tools together, and is in pre-alpha today. Not everything is in place, there are bugs, and itâ€™d be great if you could contribute feedback.

```
git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit.git
```

This page is [built](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-site) with [Enoki](http://enoki.site) and published to the (distributed) web with [Dat](http://datproject.org) and [Hashbase](https://hashbase.io/jkm/hashbase-site).
