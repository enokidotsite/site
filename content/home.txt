## Some observations

- The internet is becoming increasingly centralized.

- You should own your data.

- Entire communities are shutdown when they fail to generate revenue by the coperations that control them.

## Some ideas

- Let’s make a self-publishing tool for the open web.

- Let’s build on top of existing [open](https://github.com/choojs/choo) [source](https://beakerbrowser.com) [projects](http://hashbase.io) created by strong and growing communities.

- Let’s place an emphasis on archivability and portability. You shouldn’t be locked into a service for your work to exist.

- Let’s make it easy for the novice, enjoyable for the pro, and perfect for personal use or client comissions.

- Let’s try to be fun and light while addressing [important issues](https://www.are.na/jon-kyle-mohr/tech-ethnography) and doing it right.

- Let’s call it **[Enoki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enokitake)**.

## Steps

- Create a foundational set of tools
- Release a programmer preview

## Programmer Preview

Know some javascript? The **[Starter Kit](https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit)** glues early versions of some tools together, and is in pre-alpha today.

```
git clone https://github.com/jondashkyle/enoki-starterkit.git
```

You will run into bugs and limitations, but it’d be great if you could [report them and contribute feedback.
